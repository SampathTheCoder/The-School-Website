      </h5>
      <p>Oakridge International School organized an Inter-School District level competition to create awareness about the #SayNoToSingleUsePlastic initiative, among the children of Visakhapatnam. This is to support the recent announcement by GVMC on the complete ban of Single Use Plastic in Visakhapatnam. The common goal of the event was to educate the young generation about the ill effects of single-use plastic and the harm it is causing to our marine ecosystem.

        About 800 students from 57 schools in and around Visakhapatnam participated. The event included four competitions – Poster Making, Short Story Writing, Poetry Recitation, and Painting, all of them focussing on the theme “Say NO to plastic, Save our Oceans”
        
        Students and Parents were elated to participate in the competition and pledged to say no to single-use plastic. Oakridge Visakhapatnam UNICEF team had come up with a petition for the same which was launched by honorable GVMC Commissioner Dr. G. Lakshmisha.</p>
